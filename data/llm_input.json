    "real_text": "About this rating\nPenguins are the most abundant birds on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands group. The islands are also home to other animals including seals, flying birds and invertebrates \u2014 but no humans.\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffsannouncementon April 2, 2025, aclaim(archived) circulated that the countries hit by Trump's reciprocal tariffs included an island inhabited only by penguins.\nOne X user wrote: \"The Trump administration has put a 10 percent tariff on the Heard Island and McDonald which has a population of 0 people and is inhabited only by penguins.\"\nThe claim spread acrossFacebook(archived),X(archived),Threads(archived),Bluesky(archived) andReddit(archived).\nThe claim pertained to the Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI), an uninhabited island group that is part of the external territory of Australia and located near Antarctica. The islands are home to penguins, seals and, according to theCIA World Factbookand the Australiangovernment, no humans.\nThe Trump administration'stariffs list(archived), posted on the White House X account, did indeed include the \"Heard and McDonald Islands,\" which were hit with 10% \"discounted reciprocal\" tariffs. Therefore, we rate this claim true.\nWe reached out to the White House to ask why an island group with no human inhabitants was included on its tariffs list. We also asked why HIMI was listed separately from Australia, given the island group's classification as Australian territory and the fact that \"mainland\" Australia and HIMI were hit with the same 10% tariffs. We await the White House's reply.\nWe also reached out to the Australian Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for its latest comment on the HIMI tariffs and await a reply.\nAccording toUNESCO, which includes the island group on its World Heritage List of locations with \"outstanding universal value\":\nThe distinctive conservation value of Heard and McDonald \u2013 one of the world's rare pristine island ecosystems \u2013 lies in the complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.\nThe Australian government also highlighted the care taken to minimize human impact on the island group. According to the governmentwebsite:\nSince the first landing on Heard Island in 1855, there have been only approximately 240 shore-based visits to the island, and only two landings on McDonald Island (in 1971 and 1980).\nIn lieu of humans, the island'sinhabitantsinclude flying birds, penguins, seals and invertebrates. Penguins are the most abundant birds on the islands.\nDespite this, import and exportfiguresfrom the World Bankreportedby the Guardian appeared to show that the U.S. imported $1.4 million worth of goods from HIMI in 2022. Almost all of the imported goods were classed as \"mach and electric.\" It was not clear from the World Bank figures what specific products were imported by the U.S.\nTrump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs list included more than180 countries and territories. The tariffs were due to take effect immediately after they were announced on April 2, 2025.\nSnopes keeps a runningtrackerof the Trump administration tariffs.

    "summary": "Your claim that \"The US imposes tariffs on Penguins\" is False. The verified news article specifically states that the US imposed tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which are uninhabited by humans but home to penguins, seals, and other animals. However, the tariffs were imposed on the islands as a whole, not on the penguins themselves. TL;DR: The US imposes tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, not on penguins."
